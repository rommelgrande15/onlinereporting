                  <p>
                    <b><i>Payment</i></b><br/> Payment is expected by T/T, Paypal or other transfer to one of TIC Bank account, which is stated on the invoice.<br/> TIC will only cover his own local bank charges which are charged by HSBC Hong Kong. Any oversea or intermediary <br/>bank charges need to be covered by clients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b><i>Invoice</i></b><br/> All Inspections, Audits and Testing are billed before performance take place and need to be fully paid also in advance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b><i>Cancellation Policy and Re-inspection</i></b><br/> Cancellation deadline: We accept a cancellation of confirmed jobs during work time and workdays (Monday – Friday) <br/>until 12 pm (China Time) the day before the service date. After this limit, the booked services will be charged in full <br/>to the client. For Monday inspection, the deadline is Friday 12:00 PM.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the inspection cannot be performed due to any of below but not only reasons: Power Cut off in factory, <br/>no worker, no goods ready, no access to factory, etc, or any other reason out of the responsibility of the inspector of TIC itself.<br/> TIC will charge full cost to the client.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As our business partner is our client, we need to charge these cost also to the client. TIC advises its clients then to <br/>re-charge this cost to their factory due to the cancellation is caused by them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Re-Inspection: Usually re-inspection costs need to be covered by the factory. TIC will issue Invoice to the factory before <br/>the inspection and need to receive payment before re-inspection take place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Laboratory Testing and Certificates orders, cancellation is not possible once the Testing has been launched by the Laboratory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the event that TIC is being prevented from performing or completing in full requested Services, for any reason beyond <br/>its control, such as but not limited to, wrong information given by Client or Factory (e.g. goods not ready for Inspection despite <br/>information given by Factory, wrong address, etc.), the Customers agrees to :
                  <ul>
                    <li>Reimburse any expenditure, and out of pocket expenses made or incurred in relation to this Service ;</li>
                    <li>Pay proportion of fees due for Services actually rendered and to release TIC from all responsibility for partial or <br/>non-performance of the Services.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                <p>
                  In the event when the Inspection must be cancelled on the projected Inspection day, because of wrong information given by <br/>Client or Factory (e.g. goods not ready for Inspection despite information given by Factory,...), the man-day will be considered <br/>spent, and TIC will charge full fee to Client as a 'missed Inspection' fee. TIC advises its clients to then re-charge this cost to <br/>their factory when the factory is proved to be mistaken.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Customers provided inspection sample(s): If an inspection sample is provided by the Customers and shipped to an TIC office, <br/>and then must be re-forwarded by TIC to the Customer's factory, and the shipping charge exceeds $10 USD, then the shipping <br/>fee will be automatically added to the final invoice amount.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Laboratory Testing orders:<br/> Should the quotation given vary once the Product Samples are received and checked by TIC, it is agreed that:<br/> - if the Test price increase is less than 25% or US$ 100, TIC will inform the Client and launch the Test immediately for quicker processing.<br/> - if the Test price increase is more than 25% and US$100, TIC will seek Client's confirmation before launching the Test.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The minimum charge for any Lab Test order is US$100 for standard delivery and US$150 for express.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For any delay of payment, TIC keeps the right to charge USD 25,- for each payment reminder starting 10 days <br/>after overdue of payment date.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore TIC keeps the right to charge 13% annual interest for any unpaid overdue amount.

	parties' documents - if received by<br> TIC - are considered to be for information only and do not
	extend or restrict the scope of the services or obligations accepted by TIC.
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	<b>5. Invoicing, Fees and Payment</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	<b><i>Payment</i></b><br>
	Payment is expected by T/T, Paypal or other transfer to one of TIC Bank account, which is
	stated on the invoice.<br>
	TIC will only cover his own local bank charges which are charged by HSBC Hong Kong.
	Any oversea or intermediary <br>bank charges need to be covered by clients.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b><i>Invoice</i></b><br>
	All Inspections, Audits and Testing are billed before performance take place and need to be
	fully paid also in advance.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b><i>Cancellation Policy and Re-inspection</i></b><br>
	Cancellation deadline: We accept a cancellation of confirmed jobs during work time and
	workdays (Monday – Friday) <br>until 12 pm (China Time) the day before the service date. After
	this limit, the booked services will be charged in full <br>to the client.
	For Monday inspection, the deadline is Friday 12:00 PM.
	</p>
	<p>
	If the inspection cannot be performed due to any of below but not only reasons:
	Power Cut off in factory, <br>no worker, no goods ready, no access to factory, etc, or 
	any other reason out of the responsibility of the inspector of TIC itself.<br>
	TIC will charge full cost to the client.
	</p>
	<p>
	As our business partner is our client, we need to charge these cost also to the client.
	TIC advises its clients then to <br>re-charge this cost to their factory due to the cancellation is
	caused by them.
	</p>
	<p>
	Re-Inspection: Usually re-inspection costs need to be covered by the factory. TIC will issue
	Invoice to the factory before <br>the inspection and need to receive payment before re-inspection
	take place.
	</p>
	<p>
	For Laboratory Testing and Certificates orders, cancellation is not possible once the Testing
	has been launched by the Laboratory.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the event that TIC is being prevented from performing or completing in full requested
	Services, for any reason beyond <br>its control, such as but not limited to, wrong information
	given by Client or Factory (e.g. goods not ready for Inspection despite <br>information given by
	Factory, wrong address, etc.), the Customers agrees to :
			</p><ul>
	<li>Reimburse any expenditure, and out of pocket expenses made or incurred in
		relation to this Service ;</li>
	<li>Pay proportion of fees due for Services actually rendered and to release TIC
		from all responsibility for partial or <br>non-performance of the Services.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	In the event when the Inspection must be cancelled on the projected Inspection day,
	because of wrong information given by <br>Client or Factory (e.g. goods not ready for Inspection
	despite information given by Factory,...), the man-day will be considered <br>spent, and TIC will
	charge full fee to Client as a 'missed Inspection' fee. TIC advises its clients to then re-charge
	this cost to <br>their factory when the factory is proved to be mistaken.
	</p>
	<p>
	Customers provided inspection sample(s): If an inspection sample is provided by the
	Customers and shipped to an TIC office, <br>and then must be re-forwarded by TIC to the
	Customer's factory, and the shipping charge exceeds $10 USD, then the shipping <br>fee will be
	automatically added to the final invoice amount.
	</p>
	<p>
	For Laboratory Testing orders:<br>
	Should the quotation given vary once the Product Samples are received and checked
	by TIC, it is agreed that:<br>
	- if the Test price increase is less than 25% or US$ 100, TIC will inform the Client and
	launch the Test immediately for quicker processing.<br>
	- if the Test price increase is more than 25% and US$100, TIC will seek Client's
	confirmation before launching the Test.
	</p>
	<p>
	The minimum charge for any Lab Test order is US$100 for standard delivery and
	US$150 for express.
	</p>
	<p>

	reminder starting 10 days <br>after overdue of payment date.
